# Smart Traffic Signal Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning

An intelligent traffic signal optimization system that uses **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** with custom observation and reward functions to minimize vehicle waiting times — with built-in **emergency vehicle priority** (ambulances). Built on top of [SUMO](https://eclipse.dev/sumo/) and the [`sumo-rl`](https://github.com/LucasAlegre/sumo-rl) framework.

## Overview

Traditional traffic signals operate on fixed-time cycles, often leading to unnecessary congestion. This project replaces that with a **DQN-based reinforcement learning agent** that learns optimal signal switching strategies by observing real-time traffic conditions — including queue lengths, lane densities, and per-vehicle waiting times.

### Key Features

- **Custom Observation Function** — Injects per-lane maximum waiting times into the agent's state space alongside phase, density, and queue data.
- **Exponential Priority Reward** — Uses an exponential penalty curve (`wait^1.5`) to aggressively punish long waits; emergency vehicles receive quadratic penalties (`wait^2`) for even stronger prioritization.
- **Yellow Phase Forgiveness** — Divides penalties by 100× during yellow phases so the agent isn't afraid to switch signals.
- **Emergency Vehicle Handling** — 60 ambulances are injected into the simulation (one every 60 seconds), and the reward function explicitly prioritizes clearing them.
- **Tuned DQN Hyperparameters** — 50% exploration fraction, 2000-step warmup, and target network updates every 500 steps for stable learning.

## Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.10+
- **SUMO** (Simulation of Urban Mobility) — [Installation Guide](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/index.html)
  - Make sure the `SUMO_HOME` environment variable is set
- **GPU (optional)** — PyTorch with CUDA for faster training

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/smart-traffic-rl.git
cd smart-traffic-rl
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Train the Agent

```bash
cd src
python train.py
```

This will:
1. Train a DQN agent for **50,000 timesteps** (headless, no GUI)
2. Save the model to `models/dqn_traffic_model.zip`
3. Launch the SUMO GUI to **watch the trained agent** control the intersection

### 5. Evaluate a Pre-trained Model

```bash
cd src
python evaluate.py
```

This loads the saved model and runs inference with the SUMO GUI, printing performance metrics at the end:
- Total vehicles cleared (throughput)
- Average stop time per vehicle
- Average/maximum queue length
- Cumulative reward score

## How It Works

### Observation Space

The agent observes a feature vector containing:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Phase ID | One-hot encoding of the current green phase |
| Min Green | Whether minimum green duration has elapsed |
| Lane Density | Normalized vehicle density per lane |
| Lane Queue | Normalized queue length per lane |
| **Wait Times** | **Max accumulated waiting time per lane** (normalized by 100) |

### Reward Function

```
reward = total_penalty / 1000 (to tackle exploding gradient problem)

where for each vehicle:
  - Regular vehicle:  penalty -= wait_time^1.5
  - Emergency vehicle: penalty -= wait_time^2.0

if yellow phase:
  total_penalty /= 100  (forgiveness factor, required otherwise agent won't switch phase)
```
